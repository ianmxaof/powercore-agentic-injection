## 🌟 What is Agentic Injection?

Agentic Injection is a revolutionary system that dynamically orchestrates AI agents in development pipelines using YAML-based configuration and MetaAgent optimization. It transforms how you build, deploy, and maintain software by injecting intelligent automation at every stage.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🎯 Dynamic Agent Orchestration**: Automatically spawn and manage AI agents based on project context
- **📝 YAML-Based Configuration**: Simple, declarative rules for agent behavior and triggers
- **🧠 MetaAgent Optimization**: Self-improving system that learns from execution patterns
- **⚡ Real-time Injection**: Live modification of development workflows without restarts
- **🔧 Multi-Platform Support**: Works with web, mobile, desktop, and backend projects
- **📊 Intelligent Analytics**: Track agent performance and optimize resource usage

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- OpenAI API Key
- GitHub Token (optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ianmxaof/powercore-agentic-injection.git
cd powercore-agentic-injection

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install frontend dependencies
cd landing-page
npm install
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Configure your injection rules** in `injection_rules.yaml`:

```yaml
triggers:
  - name: "code_review"
    condition: "file_changed"
    agents:
      - name: "reviewer"
        type: "code_analysis"
        priority: "high"
  
  - name: "testing"
    condition: "test_files_modified"
    agents:
      - name: "test_generator"
        type: "test_automation"
        priority: "medium"
```

2. **Run the injection system**:

```bash
python agentic_injection_system_v2.py
```

3. **Access the dashboard**:

```bash
cd landing-page
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the live dashboard.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

- **Injection Engine**: Main orchestrator that manages agent lifecycle
- **MetaAgent**: Self-optimizing component that learns from execution patterns
- **Rule Parser**: YAML configuration interpreter
- **Agent Registry**: Dynamic agent discovery and management
- **Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring and control interface

### System Flow

```
Project Request → Rule Parser → Agent Selection → Execution → MetaAgent Analysis → Optimization
```

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- **Live YAML Editor**: Real-time rule modification
- **Agent Status Monitor**: Track running agents and their performance
- **Execution Logs**: Detailed logs of all agent activities
- **MetaAgent Insights**: Optimization suggestions and performance metrics
- **Project Templates**: Pre-configured setups for common project types

## 🔧 Configuration

### Injection Rules Format

```yaml
triggers:
  - name: "trigger_name"
    condition: "condition_type"
    agents:
      - name: "agent_name"
        type: "agent_type"
        priority: "high|medium|low"
        config:
          # Agent-specific configuration
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on push to main branch

### Local Development

```bash
# Backend
python agentic_injection_system_v2.py

# Frontend
cd landing-page
npm run dev
```
